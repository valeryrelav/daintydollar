    <h2 class="blogtitle">A 9-5 Versus your Starting Your Own Business</h2>
    <div class="blogpost">
       
       <p>Why do some people prefer a full time career versus others preferring entrepreneurship? Safety. A steady paycheck, benefits, and predictable work are definitely hard to walk away from. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a 9-5 job. However, there are people out there that just can’t thrive in that environment. The thrill and fulfillment of entrepreneurship can truly be rewarding, despite the hard work.

        Me? I prefer entrepreneurship versus a 9-5 job. Why? Because, the most important thing to me is:
   
        Freedom and Flexibility
        Freedom to do whatever I want, like get on a plane and go to Puerto Rico for a month (which I did do). Or have major flexibility where I can spend Monday mornings cuddling with my baby boy. This to me is worth the risk of starting your own business.
        
        I’m not knocking a 9-5, I worked a full-time job for the past 12 years. But, I figured out that I thrive when I’m working on different projects and most importantly, have the ability to dictate how many hours I work and how much I make. There was a boss who capped my earnings and that fueled my passion for entrepreneurship even more, there is no cap to my earnings now.
        
        I’ve had life changing jobs, amazing bosses, and was well paid. With a business, you have one boss: you. Which can be both a great thing or a really terrible one. You have to be more disciplined, wear multiple hats when you first begin, and be good at getting clients.

        GET THE MONEY BLUEPRINT TO GET YOUR $$ IN ORDER
        Get Your Finances In Order
        Before I dove head first into entrepreneurship, I had to get over my financial anxiety and get my finances in order. I started by setting up an 8 month emergency fund and I started funding my sinking funds.
        
        The beginning can feel scary because in entrepreneurship you do not have a stable income, no more paychecks every two weeks, – you have to create your income. This is an exciting and thrilling experience. Entrepreneurship is certainly not for the faint of heart. You need grit to get through the hard times, getting work done, keeping yourself and your team accountable, while continuing to grow as a business.
        
        There are two things that were complete game changers for me as I continue to grow my business:
        
        Building a Team
        Software That Creates Workflows + Automation
        Build a Team
        Building a Team was a MUST in my business. I’m very good at multiple things but I quickly realized that though I could do everything myself and “keep the profit”, I was just setting myself up to stay small and hate the job I just created for myself. Adding a team member allowed me to give parts of my business to someone that could focus on it full-time and the projects they were assigned fit their experience so they thrived in their role. Win, win.
        
        Not only was I able to clear up my plate to focus on my genius and what I Iove doing, my team began implementing new processes that made our lives easier. More work was getting done because more people could execute on the task and projects. I’m now able to focus on growing the business and CEO things.

        Software + Automation
        Adding software has reduced 80% of time spent on on-boarding, client intake, project management, bookkeeping, and so much more because it helped me automate parts of my business my team and I were spending too much time on. I highly suggest spending some time researching software that’s in your budget to eliminate unnecessary time spent on repetitive tasks. Your teams time should be spent elsewhere.
        
        My favorite tools are:
        
        Dubsado
        Toggl
        Asana
        Trello
        Quickbooks
        Slack
        All of the above are free to use but they do all offer a paid version for premium experience.
        
        Building a team and using software will make running your business so much easier. Take time building your funds so you can grow your team and plug in software that compliments your business. Starting your own business can be scary but there are simple steps you can do towards preparing yourself to make that huge leap.
